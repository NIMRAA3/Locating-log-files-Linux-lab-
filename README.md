## 🔹 Introduction

This repository contains the **Linux Log Analysis Lab**, focusing on locating, interpreting, and monitoring system and application log files.
The lab demonstrates hands-on experience with log analysis, real-time monitoring using `tail`, and identifying logs from both known (Apache) and unknown (nginx) systems.
